    Class Declarations and Modifiers 
        one public class per file
        the public class should be name after the filename

        Access                  Child Access    Same Package(Dir)     Other Package   Same Class
            public                      Y               Y                    Y             Y 
            protected                   Y               N                    Y             Y

        Non-access
            final
                class: cannot extend
                variable: constant
                method: cannot override
            abstract
            transient
            static

    The main method

        Entry point for stand-alone Java application.
            public static void main(String[] args)
        
        Local variables must be initialized, otherwise:
            Compile-time Error: local variable may not have been initialized
            
        Member variables are initialized to null by default
        Using constructors you can set proper initial values for member variables

    Constructors
        You can initialize your object's state here.
        Method named after the class name and is invoked during instantiation
        The keyword 'new' instantiates a type via its constructor and returns a reference
        Java provides a default no-arg constructor if you don't write any constructors.

    JavaBeans
        By convention class variables are generally made private
        public accessor and mutator methods are created to allow change
        1. Has a default constructor
        2. Has accessor and mutator methods
        3. Persistence

        When your class follows JavaBean conventions, it is considered a JavaBean.
        Why? JavaBeans play well with most java frameworks
